I worked on a project called [News Aggregation App](https://github.com/RocketChat/Apps.News-Aggregation) which is an app provides a centralized platform for seamless access to curated news content within the chat environment.

I would maintain this repository as the final report summary of my GSoC 2023 project and a quick guide for all future GSoC aspirants.
