I worked on a project called [News Aggregation App](https://github.com/RocketChat/Apps.News-Aggregation) which is an app that provides a centralized platform for seamless access to curated news content within the chat environment.

I would maintain this repository as the final report summary of my GSoC 2024 project and a quick guide for all future GSoC aspirants.


## ‚≠ê Project Abstract
The News-Aggregation project aims to develop a Rocket.Chat app that collects and displays news from top websites like TechCrunch. It will aggregate data using APIs and RSS feeds, allowing users to configure their preferred sources and categories. The goal is to provide a daily news feed within Rocket.Chat, enhancing the platform by offering organized and curated news content. The project focuses on Rocket.Chat app development involves technical data collection, categorization, and presentation challenges.


## üö¢ Deliverables
- Implementation of a robust news collection mechanism capable of gathering articles from various sources such as TechCrunch and other top websites, utilizing different logic to collect news from sources with APIs and RSS feeds.
- Development of a user-friendly interface for presenting news articles in a "newspaper" or "news feed" format within the Rocket.Chat environment, including summaries of articles and links to full content.
- Incorporation of a categorization system to organize news articles based on predefined categories or user-defined tags, providing flexibility and customization for users.
- Complete configurability of news sources and categories, allowing users to customize their news feed according to their preferences and interests.

These deliverables aim to provide users with a comprehensive News Aggregation App that offers convenient access to daily news from various sources within the Rocket.Chat ecosystem.
